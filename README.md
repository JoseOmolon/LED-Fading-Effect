# LED-Fading-Effect

## Analog Output. Smooth Transitions. No Handholding.

**Sixth step** in the embedded grind. This ain’t a basic on/off flicker — it’s **pulse-width modulation mastery**. **One pin. One LED. Smooth fades in and out.** You’re not just flipping bits. You’re shaping signals.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Real systems don’t just turn on — they breathe, they **transition**, they **modulate**. That’s PWM. You’re not coding light; you’re crafting it. This is how screens dim, motors hum, and LEDs dance.

### ⚙️ What I Learned

- `analogWrite()` delivers variable voltage via PWM  
- `for` loops shape time-based changes  
- Small `delay()` steps = smooth animation  
- Fading builds patience and precision — core traits in embedded design
